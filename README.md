## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-neobase/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).


_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

Mistakes by Governance: We assume that all calls that are performed by the governance address are performed with the correct parameters. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the governance to ensure that LendingLedger always contains enough CANTO.

Checkpoint is called at least once in five years: Curve and FIAT DAO have the assumption that the VotingEscrow._checkpoint function is called at least once in a five year period. Because we use the same contracts, we also inherit this assumption.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.
